        ABOUT THE CONFERENCE
The path to becoming a creative professional is not an easy one and even the path itself is hard to find. Careers in the Creative Arts is designed to inform educate and inspire students who are thinking about going down that path. It is free and open to all current and prospective students at BMCC.

If you come to the event you will get the opportunity to listen to and ask questions of people who are both creative professionals and professors at BMCC. They have both the first hand knowledge of what it takes to make it in their creative fields and e ability to communicate this information clearly.  And, being BMCC teachers, they can tell you what you can start doing now to get moving on the path to a career doing what you love.

The event is organized into four tracks that represent four broad creative fields: Creative Writing, Fine Arts, Performing Arts, Media Arts. There will be four sessions in each track with lunch provided after the first two sessions. You can attend the sessions you're interested in whether they are all in one track or across tracks.
