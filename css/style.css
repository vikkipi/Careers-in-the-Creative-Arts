/* They styles in the following are similar to the effect of a reset but have be separated out so that it is easier to add default styles.  These are suggested styles that the designer should change and add to set the typography 



Much of this is modified from two original sources
HTML 5 Doctor Reset: http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/
This is in the public domain. It has been modified to remove things redundant with Normalize and separate out styles that may need to be styled separately.

Normalize.css: git.io/normalize 
The version modified is: normalize.css v3.0.1 | MIT License
A few pieces of normalize.css that more directly affected typographic choices (such as font-family) were moved here so normalize.css could be more or less left alone.
